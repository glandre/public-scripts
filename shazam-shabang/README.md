# Shazam & Shabang

This script was created to help executing some step-by-step work, in order to
find an issue that was causing some tests to fail after an upgrade.

I wanted to upgrade some dependencies in a JavaScript (webpack/babel) project,
but I wanted to do it one by one, and for each one, I wanted to run all the tests.
